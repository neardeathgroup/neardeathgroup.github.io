              the US and taken to Africa. We landed in Rhodesia during the Bush War.&nbsp;I was later abandoned out in the countryside and&nbsp;spent the night alone in the bush. In the morning I made my way to a tribal village&nbsp;who took me in. They&nbsp;became
              my new family.&nbsp;I learned how to sing their songs, how to prepare food, how to help in the garden, and I participated in their ceremonies. One woman adopted me as her own and became my Mama.&nbsp;Weeks later, I was shot by guerrilla
              soldiers and crossed over into death.On the other side I&nbsp;met five beings who led me through my confusion and pain to acceptance, peace, and then to profound love. In this state of pure love&nbsp;I looked back and saw Mama holding my
              body and wailing.&nbsp;Though I treasured her, I resumed crossing through veils on my journey home to the Great Heart. I&nbsp;then began to hear a song that made me pause. My mama’s wailing had turned into a calling song, reminding&nbsp;me
              of my purpose for living.&nbsp;I turned around and came back to life so I could become a Medicine Singer like her.&nbsp;Like a long stream of light coming through a high stained glass window&nbsp;I returned to my body.</p>

              to share with others, and can be&nbsp;integrated into all of our lives. These are healing messages for humanity, that are&nbsp;repeated over and over again by near death experiencers. Pat’s lecture takes a&nbsp;practical look of how we can
              take the lessons of the NDE and put them into our&nbsp;everyday lives. He is a leader of the Central Texas IANDS group. Pat is a business&nbsp;owner, family man, and native Texan that lives on the banks of the Blanco River that&nbsp;almost

            <p>In 1995, Dr. Allan Botkin and a team of psychologists at the Chicago Veterans Administration Hospital, stumbled on to an exciting new therapeutic technique, Induced After-Death Communication (IADC). This intervention used by counselors to
              resolve trauma, IADC spontaneously catalyzes a state of consciousness that allows for apparent contact with individuals who have crossed over rapidly resolving overwhelming grief and loss. Clients report powerful internal visions of their
              loved ones, which can include lengthy conversations, ecstatic reunions, even kinesthetic moments where they feel hugged or touched! Unterberger will share current research from the hundreds of clients he has treated with the technique.</p>

              illness went undiagnosed for an estimated 30 years. Her NDE life mission is to help women who suffer from physical and emotional abuse. Although partially blind in one eye, in 2014 she received eight international Telly Awards of Excellence
              for a documentary she shot as a one woman crew on location in West Africa entitled “The Woe of Bo Town.”</p>
            <p>She experienced many OBEs along with dreams and visions that warned her to seek medical&nbsp;help. When she began to lose some of her sight, an MRI revealed a large tumor called a meningioma behind her left eye. During the time in which she
              waited several months for surgery, she experienced an NDE in what is called The VOID. During her NDE, she received healing from her many personal trials and struggles in life and then returned to face surgery that removed the physical tumor.
              She will speak to her experience in a visual way that conveys the emotions and communications that she felt during her NDE. She will also tell the story of a second mystical experience she had years later when she demanded to return to the
              place of healing and wonder she experienced.</p>

              childhood, traveled extensively as a young man, and lived a variety of lives as a ski bum, a factory welder, a monumental sculpture fabricator, an underground cartoonist; and finally as an award-winning illustrator, art director, and animation
              designer for The New York Times, Sports Illustrated, PBS Kids, and more.</p>
            <p>His journeys – from the remote South Pacific to the capitals of Europe to the deserts of Arizona and the canyons of New York City – were punctuated by three dramatic “Near Death Experiences.” Interspersed through a life of professional successes
              and personal setbacks, and his own “dark nights of the soul,” the three NDEs, and the subsequent need for answers, led him to years of study and meditation. Elements of Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Gnostic Christianity, physics, philosophy
              and more, have contributed to his unique transpersonal realizations about life and death. All of which inspired the calling to write his direct, humorous transformational prose, and to joyfully pass along all the lessons he’s learned – obviously
              the hard way.</p>

              Twylah Nitsch of the Seneca Nation in Boulder, Colorado in 1985 was one of the first fulfillments of the “previews of coming attractions” that she previewed during her death experience. Nancy is today a spiritual peace elder, mentor, counselor,

            <p>She was chosen by the Waitaha people to walk the International&nbsp;Sacred Prophecy Journeys for the awakening of the human consciousness and honoring&nbsp;of the sacred feminine, sister, mother, grandmother. This took many years and&nbsp;journeys
              around the world collaborating with many spiritual elders, including the&nbsp;Dali Lama. She is a founding grandmother of the Waitaha Grandmothers Council and&nbsp;keeper of the ancient ways. Nancy is known as a catalyst and innovator in

David Drapela’s life is an adventure that books are written about. From being broke, to cruising the world for years on a yacht, David has seen the highest of highs, and the lowest of lows.&nbsp;A the age
              of eleven, he borrowed $25 dollars from his Mother and opened a fireworks stand&nbsp;and&nbsp;made as much as an adult man would have made in a year. His life went on like this, from one creation to another. David says that he never had
              an original thought, he just looked to the universe for answers and followed its guidance.&nbsp; One of David’s many blessings has been his ability to write many spiritual writings. He has done this for over forty years. His&nbsp;favorite
              sayings, “Stay in the River” and “Be in the world, but not of it.”&nbsp;As a young child he had insights that were hard for adults to understand.</p>
            <p>Six years ago he felt his pulse rate begin to slip, it got slower and slower until he lost consciousness. He drifted off into a different realm, where he was met by angels and an immense and overwhelming love.&nbsp; David was then returned
              to his body with a message that if he went back to sleep, that he would not come back. Confused, and not knowing what to do when he regained consciousness, and&nbsp;went next door to his sister’s house, and asked her to take him to the hospital.&nbsp;
              Once arriving, the ER Doctor said, “Nobody walks in here with a heart rate that low.”</p>
            <p>As you join this remarkable man at the symposium, he will share insights he’s been given about life and how to live it. His loving presence is felt by everyone in the room. When he delivers his messages, it is entertaining and thought provoking.</p>

          over 100 gripping stories of near-death experiences. For decades, Burke has been studying accounts of survivors brought back from near death who lived to tell of both heavenly and hellish experiences. While not every detail of individual NDEs
          correlate with Scripture, Burke shows how the common experiences shared by thousands of survivors--including doctors, college professors, bank presidents, people of all ages and cultures, and even blind people-point to the exhilarating picture
          of Heaven.&nbsp;He and his wife founded Gateway Church in Austin, Texas, in 1998. Since then, Gateway has grown to over 3,000 people, 70 percent of whom are in their twenties and thirties, and consists mostly unchurched people who began actively
          following Christ at Gateway.</p>
